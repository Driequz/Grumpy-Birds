# Grumpy Birds

The purpose of this game is to aide players in recognizing when their heart rates are increasing so they can control their levels of frustration that appears while gaming.



## Requirements
------------------------------------------

You will need to download the program called **Unity**. To get this program please refer to this link
(https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) 

Sometimes it may or may not ask you to **make an account**, if it does simply make one as it is free and will make things easier in the future.

Please note that I am currently running Unity on verison **2018.3.4f1 Personal** So if any issues arise, please check to see whether or not you're using the correct version.

You will also need to download **AFFECTIVA SDK** to run this game. To get this package please use this link (https://knowledge.affectiva.com/v3.2/docs/getting-started-with-the-emotion-sdk-for-unity)

**Note** This package will be used so that the game can use your camera on your computer to check your facial expressions. So it is **Mandatory** that you run the game on a computer that has a camera or you will only be allowed to run the **Vanilla** version of the game.


 ## Running the Game
 ------------------------------------------
 
 __To compile and run:__

Once you get Unity installed and running:
Make sure that you are in the correct **scene**. To do this double click the **intro** button

![The correct scene to click is highlighted blue](https://github.com/Driequz/Grumpy-Birds/blob/master/correct_scene.png)
click the **start** button at the top of the Unity program and make sure that "**Maximize on play**" is selected

## Playing the game

You will notice that the game starts at the **Main Menu** screen.

This is because there are 2 options that you can choose from depending on what type of gaming experience you may want.

To play the game in the default (vanilla) state then click the **Without face** button, as shown by the picture below

To play the game using your facial expressions you will click the **With face** button, as shown by the picture below

To play the game in the **Vanilla** mode you will need to click the **left mouse** button on your mouse, or just click the left part of your **touch pad**

To play the game with your facial expressions you will need to start **smiling** as soon as the game starts to give the camera time to register your face during the **buffer** period. Then to fall back down simply **stop smiling**

The **Buffer** period, is the time where you character cannot move for 3 seconds to allow time for the camera to load up and start detecting your face, otherwise you will instantly crash and die.

## How to Win
 ------------------------------------------
 
The goal of this game is to safely navigate the bird through the pipes without touching the ground, or the pipes. Each successful pass through the pipe will add a point to the score counter below.

## Hints

Please not that there is no **Ceiling** in the game, meaning if you fly too high you will be off-screen and may hit a pipe that is spawning off-screen.

Also, be aware that the bird has an actual **weight** meaning that you will have to smile in preparation of the bird dropping due to gravity. If you smile then stop smiling and smile too late, since the bird is heavy it won't begin flying in time for you to live.
